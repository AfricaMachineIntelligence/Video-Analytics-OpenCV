    "# OpenCV Tutorial Sample 12: ocv_face_cnt_vid\n",
    "\n",
    "[Sample 12](sample_12/ocv_face_cnt_vid.py) is a basic People Counter using the previous Face and Eye Detection program that uses OpenCV to analyze real-time video and detect human faces and eyes. In addition to detecting Faces and Eyes, the program also returns the number of faces detected to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "This program counts the number of faces seen in a frame and sends the output to console. It does not perform  a cumulative count. This because the detection is done on every frame of the video and unless faces were recognized and ignored in the following frame, each face would be counted multiple times per frame and produce erroneous results.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such a people counter that counts faces needs to also have face recognition capabilities to be robust and perform a cumulative count.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of digital signage, this example can be used to detect whether a sign is being seen by a single individual on more than one individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample is identical to the previous sample with the following exception:\n",
    "It uses the numpy len() function to count the number of elements in the array of rectangles for the faces detected after the cascade classifier is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "print('Number of faces detected: ' + str(len(faces)))\n",
