    "\n",
    "[Sample 05](ocv_ocl_info.py) is a simple diagnostic program that determines whether OpenCL is available for use within OpenCV, Enables OpenCL, checks whether it has been enabled and then disables it. The program then checks if OpenCL has been disabled and exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is OpenCL?\n",
    "OpenCLâ„¢ (Open Computing Language) is the open standard for parallel programming. Using OpenCL, one can use the GPU for parallel computing tasks other than just for graphics programming. Once can also use DSP's, FPGA's and other types of processors using OpenCL.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  How does OpenCV use OpenCL?\n",
    "In Computer Vision many algorithms can run on a GPU much more effectively than on a CPU: e.g. image processing, matrix arithmetic, computational photography, object detection etc. OpenCV 3.x is able to accelerate and optimize performaance by using an architectural concept called Transparent API (T-API) to transparently speed up certain tasks if supported by the underlying hardware.\n",
